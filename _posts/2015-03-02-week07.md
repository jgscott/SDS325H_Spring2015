title: Week 7 (March 2-4, 2015)
---


On Monday, we will (mostly) finish up our discussion of probability.  Key concepts include:  
* random variable  
* probability distribution  
* probability mass function  
* probability density function  
* likelihood  


On Wednesday, we will go over HW 6 and then continue our discussion of permutation tests, especially in the context of a regression model.  Key concepts include:  
* R-squared as a test statistic  
* alpha level  
* p value  
* Neyman-Pearson testing framework  


### Reading

Last week you read two set of notes:
* [Probability]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/probability.pdf)  
* [Random variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/randomvariables.pdf)  

In the Random Variables notes, you don't need to worry about the material on joint distributions (page 5 onwards) for the midterm, just pages 1-4. 

In addition to this older material on probability, please make sure you are familiar with the following sections of OpenIntro: Statistics (linked through the Resources tab): Sections 2.4-2.5; Section 3.1 on the normal distribution; and Section 3.5.2 on the Poisson distribution.  Some of this will be review from my own course packet.

Finally, please read Chapter 7 of the course packet on hypothesis tests, through (but not including) the section entitled "Hypothesis testing for regression coefficients."  That is, you can stop halfway down page 157.


### Exercises  
[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises07-SDS325H.pdf) introduce you to the principle of maximum likelihood and continue with a permutation test for a regression problem.
