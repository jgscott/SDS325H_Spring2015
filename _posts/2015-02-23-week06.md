title: Week 6 (February 23-25, 2015)
---


On Monday, we will continue our discussion of the normal linear regression model.  We will emphasize the assumptions and results on standard errors and predictions intervals, deferring the math until later.  We will then start our treatment of probability in earnest.

On Wednesday, we will continue our discussion of probability and random variables.


### R skills

The following walkthrough on permutation tests will be necessary for you to complete the homework:  
* [Titanic, revisited](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/titanic/titanic_permtest.html): relative risk, odds ratios, and permutation tests in 2x2 contingency tables.  

### Reading

Read my notes on:  
* [Probability]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/probability.pdf)  
* [Random variables]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/randomvariables.pdf)   


### Exercises  
[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises06-SDS325H.pdf) introduce you to permutation tests.  They also have some problems involving basic probability.  The exercises are due on Monday, March 2.
