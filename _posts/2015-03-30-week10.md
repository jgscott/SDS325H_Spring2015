title: Week 10 (March 30-31, 2015)
---

On Monday we will talk about t statistics, go over HW 8, and continue our discussion of the central limit theorem as it is used in statistical inference. 

On Wednesday, we will talk about logistic regression.  Key ideas:  
* link function.  
* linear probability model.  
* conditional probability.  



### R skills

Please complete the walkthrough on [college basketball point spreads](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/bball/bball.html), which introduces logistic regression.  


### Reading and exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises09-SDS325H.pdf)cover logistic regression, tests for a difference in proportions, and the problem of cherry picking/multiple testing in data-driven hypothesis generation.

Please read Chapter 9 of the course packet on modeling binary outcomes.  (Note that we are temporarily skipping Chapter 8.)

In addition, please read the article "Selective Reporting Biases in Cancer Prognostic Factor Studies."  Panayiotis A. Kyzas, Konstantinos T. Loizou and John P. A. Ioannidis.  J Natl Cancer Inst (20 July 2005) 97 (14): 1043-1055. doi: 10.1093/jnci/dji184.  This should be accessible through the [UT Library portal](http://www.lib.utexas.edu) or simply through a web search.
