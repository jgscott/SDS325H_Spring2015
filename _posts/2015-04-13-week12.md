On Monday we finish up talking about the Cox proportional-hazards model and discuss the two papers you read for your last homework.  We then will begin discussing a batch of related topics:  
* hidden sources of error and confounding in experimental design and analysis  
* pseudo-replication  
* weighting  
* hierarchical models  

On Wednesday we will continue discussing hierarchical models.
