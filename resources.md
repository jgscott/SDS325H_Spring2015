Course packet
-------------

This is in a state of continual editing, so I will post the
  chapters as they become relevant. 

* [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/00-FrontMatter-Intro.pdf)  
* [Chapter 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/01-ExplanationsAndEvidence.pdf)
* [Chapter 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/02-ExploringMultivariateData.pdf)


Other readings
--------------

* [Data Analysis for Politics and Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/DAPP.pdf) by Edward Tufte.  Out of print, but available for free in electronic form. I will often assign supplemental readings out of this book.  
* [Statistical Modeling: A Fresh Approach](http://www.mosaic-web.org/go/StatisticalModeling/Chapters/) by Daniel Kaplan.  Great book, great exercises.  The first five chapters are available for free.  You will find the first one especially helpful in learning some basic R commands.  You are not required to buy this book, but you may find it a useful resource. Readings will be assigned out of the first five (free) chapters.
* [Using R for Introductory Statistics](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf).  A useful guide on doing basic statistics in R.
* [OpenIntro: Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php).  A free online statistics textbook that I will refer to many times throughout the semester for supplemental readings.


Good places to get help with R
------------------------------
*[R Seek](http://rseek.org).  A front-end for Google that helps get more Relevant results.  
*[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). Just search for a relevant question and somebody has probably answered it before.
